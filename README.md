- 👋 Hi, I’m @Popp98
- 👀 I’m trying to learn some coding language and especially Python
- 🌱 I mostly know how to use Python so I'm trying to get myself into C++
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate rn but idk, if you want I can help you (That will be a encouraging help rather than a real help due to my coding's skill)
- 📫 If you want to contact me (idk why) here is my discord : Rutabaga#9615
- 🙂 Have a good day !
